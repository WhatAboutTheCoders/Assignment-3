            <h4> <b> GROUP REFLECTION </b> </h4>
            <li>
              <h3> Group Reflection </h3>
              <p> Over the course of this assignment, we collaborated using a wide variety of tools. Most notably, all meetings, communication, and file-sharing took place in Microsoft Teams. Other
                Microsoft tools such as Word and Excel were used to write-up drafts of our work, which were then sent over to GitHub when completed. When crafting the basic prototype for our mobile
                application, our group used two main tools. Proto.io was used as our primary tool for creating the user interface and served as a perfect platform for us to test out different design
                aesthetics, and Visual Studio Code was our application of choice for writing the CSS and HTML components of our group website. Finally, we also used GitHub as a repository to host
                our finished website. It could be argued that we may have underutilized GitHub, however we decided to use Microsoft Teams for all file-sharing and collaboration as we felt that it
                provided a much more streamlined and efficient user-experience. <br><br>
                Our team built quite a strong rapport with each other during our work on Assignment 2, and this carried over into Assignment 3. All team members got on well and appeared to be more
                than willing to help each other whenever required. Across the board, we felt that we operated well as a team and maintained solid lines of communication. We made a concentrated effort
                to learn from some of the shortcomings that we highlighted when reflecting on Assignment 2. Most notably, meetings were held with greater regularity, with our team clocking a total
                of 277 minutes’ worth of meeting time over the course of this project. Likewise, meetings were scheduled further in advance than during Assignment 2. This meant that tasks were
                delegated more effectively, progress updates were provided more regularly, and attendance was generally much higher than before. Having said that, we still found ourselves working
                lengthy hours during the final weekend before this assignment’s due date trying to make last-minute changes to our project. <br><br>
                Our group’s strong rapport was further highlighted over the course of the past two weeks, which saw one of our team members unable to take on as much work as they would have liked due
                to unforeseen circumstances. While this posed an early challenge for us, our team did an excellent job in rallying together and redistributing work while supporting each other
                as best we could. <br><br>
                Ultimately, this project has been a rewarding learning experience for every member of our team. We have been faced with several difficult challenges throughout the duration of this
                course, however we have maintained a powerful desire to produce results which we believe has served us well.  </p>

              <h3> Joe Sharratt </h3>
              <p> Our group did a really good job of building upon the momentum from Assignment 2. We jumped straight into meetings to talk about how we would move forward with Assignment 3 and tried to action
                any and all points that we had highlighted during our previous group reflections. With that in mind, I believe that we did a great job of achieving our target of holding two meetings per week.
                Likewise, I feel that the levels of communication were excellent throughout the entire project. Tasks were delegated effectively, and team members constantly appeared willing to help each other
                when needed. <br><br>
                One thing I was really surprised about during this project was the way in which everyone rallied around Victoria when her schedule prevented her from doing as much work as she would have
                liked on this assignment. Our group got off to a relatively rocky start, with two of our original team-members leaving suddenly. However, since then I believe that our group has formed a solid
                rapport with each other. In the case of Victoria’s high workload outside of her studies, this solid rapport meant that the rest of the team was more than happy to rally around and support her
                by picking up some of the workload, or by being flexible with meeting times etc. <br><br>
                Having said that, there were still things that I felt we could have done better. I feel that we still underused meeting agendas and failed to take thorough meeting minutes, which meant that
                meetings could have been a bit more efficient. However, I would argue that we largely overcame this through our constant communication in MS Teams.<br><br>
                If I had to choose one thing, I learnt about group work in general over the course of this project I think I would have to point to the importance of regular communication. The importance
                of communication became clear in the early stages of Assignment 2, when an avoidable breakdown in communication led to two team members ultimately leaving our group. On the other hand, high
                levels of communication across our entire team during Assignment 3 meant that our efforts were far more coordinated and effective than in Assignment 2.<br><br>
                Finally, I believe that our team may have underused GitHub compared to some of the other teams in our cohort. However, we found that when we attempted to use GitHub, it largely slowed us
                down and made us less efficient. Considering we were hosting all meetings and all communications through Microsoft Teams; it made a lot more sense to use Teams as our sole source of
                file-sharing as well.

              <h3> Jordan Glen </h3>
              <p> During this assignment I was appointed the task of being the team leader, a role I was nervous to take on. Being assigned put pressure and responsibility on me, to which are two of my personal
                greatest motivators, and therefore I took this role seriously, doing my best to organise team meetings, and set the general layout for the team. With that being said, I also did my best to not
                overstep as the leader and asked the team (to which they stepped up greatly) to support me in this role by suggesting ideas and roles themselves. As a leader, I often found myself going to the
                team to find out what their opinions are. <br><br>
                This assignment has taught me a lot about working as a team in a professional-type setting, as well as time management when things go wrong; I was one of the people with unexpected personal
                life circumstances appearing, where I spent most of week 11 with a broken laptop I had been sending in to get repaired, and having it come back worse I then went elsewhere and bought a new laptop. <br><br>
                I feel like Microsoft Teams again was our greatest help, and GitHub doesn’t adequately display the efforts we’ve made as a group.

              <h3> Nelson Lay </h3>
              <p>The team built on the momentum from Assignment 2 having already learned each team members strengths and weaknesses, we continued with regular meetings each week at a cadence of two meetings per week.
                Once again, everyone on the team was flexible with other team members schedules when scheduling meetings and each team member communicated any scheduling issues in a professional manner. An improvement
                we could have made was to start building the website and discussing the video presentation component a little earlier in the project. After working together on Assignment 2, I was already aware of how
                committed all the team members were, however it was a nice surprise to see how deeply committed everyone was, this was evident some mornings when I woke to see some team members had worked on the
                project into the late evening and was surprised to MS Teams messages at 4AM. One thing I learned was how vital early and honest communication is when working in a team setting. This was crucial in
                ensuring we were able to deliver this project on time, especially with all team members working full-time jobs, it meant there were times when a team member may not have been unable to meet a
                particular deadline. Having this early and honest communication meant the team could quickly pivot and re-assign tasks as needed to keep the project on track.

              <h3> Victoria Sabino </h3>
              <p>Personally, a lot has happened in the past few weeks we’ve been working on this Assignment. I think we learned how to compromise better and work together in a more convenient way despite everybody’s
                busy schedules. It’s been a wild ride for me, working two jobs and all barely getting any sleep but it was all good as I had a very good group support system. There were all very understanding
                and compassionate that we were able to pull through. Massive thanks to everyone who has been hands on towards this assignment. Nonetheless, I managed to contribute on this assignment despite
                doubting myself immensely due to unforeseen circumstances which I think is a good sign of resilience..
