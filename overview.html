                  <h3> GERD HEALTH & FITNESS </h3>
                  <p>Mobile app development is a rapidly increasing technological pathway which creates conveniency for people of all ages and cultures, offering a wide array of possibilities including
                    games and media, business and finance, and health/fitness applications. </p>

                  <p>For our group project, we plan to design prototypes for an Android and iOS application that will assist sufferers of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD for short) to find
                    out what foods they can and can’t eat, monitor their diet and symptoms, provide feedback based on those criteria, and hosts a meal planning nutrition calculator specific to
                    people with GERD who are not just trying to find out which foods they can and can’t eat, but also to set up a diet which will help them to pursue health and fitness goals.  </p>

                  <p>Although there are apps currently available which resemble parts of the proposed GERD Health & Fitness app, none of them meet all of these topics/requirements, grouping
                    a large variety of useful tools and information together in one place of convenience; a single app to be downloaded on the user’s phone. </p>

                  <p> The convenience mentioned above is also why we have selected to create a phone app rather than a website, as well as the fact that a mobile app can be
                    personalised easier and therefore tailored exactly to the client’s needs such as saved/personalised data and helpful notification reminders.  </p>
                  <p> Our group has a common interest/motivation in our desire to help people in need. Because of this, the opportunity to create an app that could potentially do exactly
                    this was too good for us to pass up. One of our group members, Jordan Glen, is personally affected by GERD and has undergone quite a tough time dealing with it, including
                    almost daily pains, regurgitation, nausea, and many of the other pre-mentioned symptoms of GERD. Jordan has also been forced to completely change his diet and underwent
                    investigative surgery to finally be diagnosed after having suffered with it for the seven years before then, untreated.  </p>
                  <p>GERD is a condition that has a wide array of symptoms, and yet (albeit sometimes requiring the assistance of medication or further surgery) changes in food and liquid
                    consumption can have a drastically positive affect on the reduction of these symptoms, and the ability to allow the body to heal before further damage is done. If the
                    person fails to do this they can end up with progressively worsening symptoms and the growth of ulcers on their stomach (Danisa M. Clarrett, MD 2018).  </p>
                  <p> GERD can also affect a person’s body weight, and as such, many sufferers will go on to set fitness goals, that without very specific diet advise, unfortunately will be
                    extremely difficult, sometimes impossible to achieve.</p>
                  <p> If this app was seen by future employers in the IT industry, it would demonstrate our ability to develop and maintain mobile software, work well in teams, and commitment
                    towards helping people in need. </p>
                  <p> As mentioned earlier, there are already some apps/websites that portray some aspects of what we intend to put into our application, such as: </p>
                   •	<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/acid-reflux-ger-gerd-adults">Acid Reflux (GER & GERD) in Adults </a> <br>
                   •	<a href="https://aboutgerd.org/"> ABOUT GERD </a> <br>
                   •	<a href="https://www.gerdhelp.com/GERD"> Help Mobile App </a> <br>
                   •	<a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/industry/npc/Pages/nutrition-panel-calculator.aspx"> Nutrition Panel Calculator </a> <br>
                   •	<a href="https://nutrium.com/Nutrium"> Nutrium </a> <br>

                  <p>However, the above-listed websites and applications suit very specific purposes, meaning that a sufferer of GERD will then have to jump from website to website
                    or use multiple applications just to get the same result that is planned to be placed into this one single, easy to use phone app. </p>
